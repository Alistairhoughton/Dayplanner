# Dayplanner

A simple dayplanner built with Jquery, HTML and css. 

## About

I have created a simple but functional day planner to help someone structure their working day. The timeblocks are colour coded for past, present and future events. 
This is donw with a function which compares the current timeblock time to the users real time. See code below for a snippet.

Additionally as a bonus. Although not required to increase functionality I added a clear schedule button. Which was simple to implement as the users data is stored in 
local storage. Thus a very easy function added to clear local storage if needed. See snippet below
